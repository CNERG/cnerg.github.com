<h1>Employment Opportunities<a class="headerlink" href="#employment-opportunities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>CNERG is frequently seeking additional group members at all levels to
assist us in our mission of delivering new computing capability for
the analysis of nuclear energy systems.</p>
<p>While each position will require specialized skills to fulfill that
role, staff and students at all levels will be expected to be
proficient with the basic tools of robust software development.  We
often refer to these skills collectively as <a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/">Software Carpentry</a>.</p>

<h2>Graduate Student Opportunities<a class="headerlink" href="#graduate-student-opportunities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Specific opportunities, if any, are listed above. There may also be
opportunities for exceptional students in the general areas identified
below.  All of these tasks will require programming and software development
and students with demonstrated experience with <a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/">Software Carpentry</a> skills
will be preferred.  Prospective students are encouraged to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.grad.wisc.edu/education/admissions/">apply for graduate
study in our department</a> and
draw specific attention to these topics, indiciating what unique knowledge or
experiences they will bring to these tasks.</p>
<div class="section" id="phd-topics">
<h3>PhD Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#phd-topics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Hybrid Acceleration Schemes for Multi-physics Problems Driven by Monte
Carlo Radiation Transport</strong> Work in this area will extend existing
methodologies for accelerating Monte Carlo radiation transport for
multi-physics problems, looking at a wider variety of other physics coupling
and over different regions of phase space.</li>
<li><strong>Shape Optimization for Radiation Transport</strong> This will explore algorithms
for optimizing the shape of engineered systems to achieve specific
performance goals.  Such methods are widespread in other engineering
disciplines but are not yet widely adopted for radiation transport problems.</li>
<li><strong>Data Science Approaches for Nuclear Non-Proliferatin</strong> A growing set of
data streams is available for use by various agencies for the detection of
the misuse of nuclear material and nuclear facilities.  This project will
explore the use of novel algorithms and methodologies for the automated
analysis of these data streams to support decision making.</li>
<li><strong>Socioeconomic Metrics for Advanced Nuclear Fuel Cycles</strong> This will
develop software algorithms to convert fundamental fuel cycle
simulation results into quantities that are relevant for
socioeconomic assessment of those fuel cycles.</li>

<div class="section" id="master-s-topics">
<h3>Master&#8217;s Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#master-s-topics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Robust workflows for CAD-based Monte Carlo radiation transport</strong>
This will require understanding of computational geometry, mesh
generation, and manipulation of mesh to improve the robustness of
analysis workflows to imperfections in the geometry or the geometry
processing steps.</li>
<li><strong>Generalized High Throughput Support for Monte Carlo Radiation
Transport</strong> This project will develop scripts and tools to
distribute Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations across a
large set of loosely coupled computing resources, including:
multi-job setup, multi-job control and monitoring, and multi-job
aggregation.  Target platforms will include UW-based HTCondor
resources, Open Science Grid, and Amazon EC2.  The tools will be
implemented in PyNE for robustness and longevity.</li>

<h3>Undergraduate Opportunities<a class="headerlink" href="#undergraduate-opportunities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CNERG is happy to provide opportunities for interested undergraduates to
become involved in our computational research.  As with most research groups,
there are frequently tasks and assignments that are appropriate for an
undergraduate who is just developing their research skills.  The following
paragraphs will hopefully give you an idea of what to expect if you were to
join our CNERG community.</p>
<p>Many research groups will assign repetitive tasks to undergraduates that
require minimal skills as a way for them to contribute and learn about the
research.  An overarching principle of our computational group is to automate
repetitive tasks by writing software.  A primary consequence of this is a
relatively steep learning curve for new undergraduates who join the CNERG
community, whether for the computational tools we use in our work or the
software development skills we use to develop new capability.</p>
<p>When you join the CNERG team as an undergraduate, you will be assigned some
exploratory tasks intended to improve the automation of our workflows and
effectiveness of our researchers.  You will probably be assigned to work
closely with a graduate student who will be the primary mentor of your work.
Ideally, you will be able to spend nearly 10 hours/week on this work in order
to make adequate progress and avoid the inefficiency of context switching
every time you return to this work.  It may not be possible to offer you a
private desk for this work.</p>
