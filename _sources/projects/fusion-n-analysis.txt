Method and Tools for Fusion Neutronics
=========================================

The realm of fusion neutronics includes a number of different analysis types
and subsequently a number of different individual analysis methodologies and
related tools.  This is a brief introduction to those analysis types,
methodologies and tools.  As fusion neutronics is a particular application of
the general area of radiation protection and shielding, much of this will
apply to other systems as well.  However, fusion neutronics is characterized
by high energy neutrons, large source terms, and substantial shielding
requirements.

Analysis Types
--------------

Radiation Transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest type of analysis is one with the single purpose of
estimating/predicting the flux of radiation throughout an engineering system.
Given a description of the radiation source, tools that perform radiation
transport simulations will determine the the flux of radiation at different
locations, as a function of energy and angle.  It is common to integrate over
angle to report the scalar flux as this quantity is directly related to the
effects of this radiation.  It is also common to integrate over energy,
although sometimes in a number of non-overlapping energy sub-domains,
typically referred to as *groups*.

There are two primary methodologies used in radiation tranpsort: discrete
ordinates (also called S_N) and Monte Carlo.

Discrete Ordinates
+++++++++++++++++++

The discrete ordinates methodology is a deterministic approach that
discretizes the full linear transport equation for numerical solution.  The
angular domain is discretized into a number of discrete directions, known as
discrete ordinates.  More fidelity arises from including more discrete
directions, but the computational complexity also increases.  One parameter of
a discrete ordinates simulation is the number of angles (S_N).  S_8
simulations have XXX angles, S_16 simulations have YYY angles, etc.
 
The scattering cross-sections are also mathematically expanded based on a set
of basis functions, typically the set of Legendre polynomials.  More fidelity
arises from including more terms in this expansion.  Including only the scalar
term and first order term is effectively the same as the diffusion
approximation.  More terms are typically included to account for anisotropy in
neutron scattering.  Thus, another parameter of a discrete ordinates
simulation is the number of terms in this expansiion (P_N).  The order of
expansion also indicates the polynomial order of anisotropy that can be
captured by this expansion.  

The energy domain is also typically discretized into a number of energy
groups, G.  A group flux is defined as the integral of the energy dependent
flux over the domain of that group.  Group cross-section constants are defined
such that the product of the group flux and he group cross-section is
mathematically identical to the integral of the product of the energy
dependent flux and the energy dependent cross-section.  Fidelity is increased
by including more energy groups, G, since it allows the simulation to better
capture the effects of resonances in the cross-section.  The fusion community
has a strong preference for 175 neutron groups between 0 and 20 MeV.

Finally, a discrete ordinates simulation requires a discretization of space.
Historically, a Cartesian grid has been used to approximate space.  This is
intrinsically an approximation to any curved surface that may exist in the
geometry.  Fidelity is typically increased by lowering the resolution of the
grid.  It is also possible to increase fidelity by employing advanced methods
to determine the mixture of materials in any single mesh element.  More
recentyl, method have been developed to implement the discrete ordinates
simulation on tetrahedral mesh that can be generated to conform to complex
surface boundaries.  This can increase the fidelity but add some computational
complexity.

In the United States, the fusion community has relied extensively on PARTISN
(formerly DANTSYS), developed by LANL.  PARTISN uses an orthogonal grid and
allows the user to determine the fidelity of the angular, energy and spatial
discretizations.  PARTISN provides special modes for 1-D and 2-D Cartesian,
cylindrical and spherical geometries.  These are particularly well suited to
parametric simulation and design iterations as they require computer runtimes
on the order of seconds to minutes.

Since about 2000, Atilla, commercialized by Transpire (now Varian) as a
spin-off from LANL, has provided a robust tool for performing discrete
ordinates simulations on a tetrahedral mesh using a finite-elment formulation.
Every model is intrinsically 3-dimensional, making it somewhat less suitable
for quick parametric study and/or design iteration.  However, because it can
faithfully represent complex geometries, it can offer much higher fidelity
simulation that tools such as PARTISN.

DENOVO, part of the Exnihilo suite from ORNL, is the newest discrete ordinates
tool.  It only supports Cartesian grids, but because it is designed for use on
the world's largest supercomputers, it can rely on very fine spatial
resolution to overcome the challenges of this modeling limitation.  It is also
intrinsically 3-D, and not always straightforward to model
cylindrical/toroidal systems that do not fill a full octant of space.

Delayed Radiation Effects



Fusion neutronics is, in general, a subset of radiation protection and
shielding.


CNERG research lies at the middle of a continuum of computational
work, with pure methods development at one end and pure systems
analysis at the other.  CNERGâ€™s goal is to help improve capability for
real analysis of complex systems by investigating and implementing new
methods in production software tools.  The primary product of our work
is a suite of technology to enable these analyses, although much of
our :doc:`funding <funded>` comes from analysis efforts.

While both areas deal with topics at the core of nuclear engineering,
the efforts of CNERG are divided between a neutronics_ group and a `fuel
cycle`_ group.

.. _neutronics:

Neutronics
----------

The cornerstone of the CNERG neutronics group's work is the Direct
Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC_) toolkit.  This ray-tracing
interface to the MOAB_ software library allows Monte Carlo radiation
transport software to perform ray-tracing and related operations
directly on CAD-based representations of complex geometry.  DAGMC has
been successfully integrated with MCNP5 from Los Alamos National
Laboratory to produce the DAG-MCNP5 package.

Current research based on the DAGMC technology includes:

**DAGMC performance improvements using novel surface meshing
algorithms**: The benefit of the OBB-tree accelerations that are
vital to DAGMC's performance can be undermined by a faceting of the
CAD surfaces that produces vertices that are shared by too many
facets: so-called *high valence vertices*.  Different faceting
algorithms will be compared with some mesh cleanup algorithms to
identify schemes to arrive at a faceting that is better suited to
the OBB-tree acceleration scheme for challenging problems.

**Unstructured mesh tallies with alternative estimators**: With
complex geometry and 3-D source definitions now common-place, the
focus turns to the ability to tally results in Monte Carlo
simulations with better fidelity.  The Cartesian overlay mesh common
to most solutions introduces physical approximations for complex
geometry that does not align conveniently with such a grid.  This
work uses conformal unstructured mesh to define the tally mesh for a
traditional track-length estimator, and then explores alternative
estimators such as the kernel density estimator applied at mesh nodes
rather than across mesh elements.

**High-fidelity shutdown dose workflow for activated systems**: Known
as the *Rigorous-2-Step* method, or R2S, in fusion neutronics, this
workflow performs a multi-group spatially resolved neutron transport
calculation to determine neutron fluxes throughout the system, uses
those fluxes to determine the isotopic change in the activated
materials, and then samples the photon source that arises from that
activation to perform a detailed photon dose calculation at various
times after the shutdown of the neutron source.  The critical
research & development steps are the generation of material
definitions for Cartesian grid elements superimposed on a complex
geometry, and the efficient sampling of a grid-based multi-group
photon source.

**Hybrid deterministic-Monte Carlo workflow**: For nearly 2 decades,
the use of deterministic hybrid approaches to Monte Carlo variance
reduction have been explored and refined.  Extending this capability
to the CAD-based DAGMC transport problems requires the generation of
a mesh for use in the deterministic solution.  Leveraging the
improvements made for the R2S workflow above, this process should be
straightforward and allow most of the normal hybrid technology to be
applied directly to DAGMC-based problems.

In addition, students in this area often pursue :doc:`spin-off
projects <spinoffprojects>` through collaborations with national
laboratories.

.. _fuel cycle:

Fuel Cycle
-----------

The CNERG fuel cycle group's `Cyclus <http://cyclus.github.com>`_
project was recently selected as the base infrastructure for the
Department of Energy's Next-Generation Fuel Cycle Simulator.  This
project aims to address gaps in the available simulator tools by:

* modeling discrete facilities and material transactions
* using an agent-based approach with dynamically loadable plugins to
  encapsulate behavior
* open source development pratices to lower the barrier to adoption
* common physics infrastructure with alternative output layers for
  different user communities.

In addition to developing the `core technology`_ as a team, the following
research areas are also being pursued by individual CNERG members:

* geologic repository model (Cyder_) with plugin architecture for repository
  physics models
