As part of the
`Consortium for Verification Technology <http://cvt.engin.umich.edu/>`_ (CVT),
|Cyclus| is being used to study issues in nuclear security and
non-proliferation. Research areas include the incorporation of
social-behavioral models to agent interactions, nuclear material tracking and
forensics, and detector sensitivity estimation.

|Cyclus| sits at the intersection of several thrusts of the CVT mission.
|Cyclus| incorporates signals available to inspectors with behavorial models
for diversion to inform detector development and analysis techniques.
