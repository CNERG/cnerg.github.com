Project/Research Assistant Opportunity (2015): Social-Behavioral Modeling of Nuclear Proliferation
==================================================================================================

*[Updated: May 26, 2015]*

As part of the Consortium for Verification Technology
(http://cvt.engin.umich.edu/), we seek a graduate assistant to work on
social-behavioral modeling of nuclear proliferation, with a focus on
international security and methodology.  The Computational Nuclear Engineering
Research Group (CNERG) is leading the development of a novel open-source
agent-based simulator to look at advanced nuclear fuel cycles, |Cyclus|
(http://fuelcycle.org). This modeling tool combines concepts from operations
research, computer science and nuclear engineering to provide a flexible basis
for studying the technical, socioeconomic, and non-proliferation impacts of
different nuclear fuel cycle choices.  A particular focus of the |Cyclus|
project for the next few years is to use the simulator to study nuclear
materials diversion and proliferation scenarios.  

CNERG is seeking a graduate assistant (33%) to assist in the development of
quantitative social-behavioral models to represent proliferation risks.  Due
to funding restrictions, only US citizens can be considered.


Experience
----------
* Masters or PhD student in Political Science, Public Policy, Computer Science,
  Engineering or related field
* Experience with quantitative representation of social-behavioral models
  (such as game theory, Bayes nets, network science models) or risk perception
* No programming experience required, but willingness to learn C++ is a plus


Specific Duties
---------------

* Develop a quantitative framework to model the likelihood of covert nuclear material diversion, at individual or regional levels.
* Run simulations and analyze results to assess relative proliferation risk with different types of behavior or fuel cycle structure.

  
To be considered for an hourly Project Assistant position (33% plus tuition
remission), please send a letter of interest, resume, and unofficial transcript
to wilsonp _at_ engr.wisc.edu.
