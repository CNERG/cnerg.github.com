Research Assistant Opportunity (2019): Data Science for Nuclear Non-Proliferation
=================================================================================

*[Updated: March 27, 2019]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) is a leading
participant in Data Science research thrust area of the `Consortium for
Enabling Technology and Innovation <http://eti.gatech.edu>`_.  This thrust
area will integrate cutting edge algorithms for machine learning and data
fusion with evolving data streams to enhance the ability to identify misuse of
nuclear materials and facilities.  The collaboration includes researchers from
the U. Wisconsin-Madison, U. Michigan, Duke, MIT, Texas A&M, Georgia Tech,
Washington State, & U. Hawaii, as well as a number of DOE National
Laboratories.  The four over-arching research areas within this thrust are:
  * Framework for rapid evaluation of algorithms and data streams
  * Fundamental advances in data science algorithms
  * Machine-guided learning and data collection
  * Incorporation of novel data streams

CNERG researchers will lead the application of these technologies to problems
relevant to the nuclear non-proliferation mission, with a particular focus on
the development of the integrating framework.
    
CNERG is seeking a qualified individual to assist in the application of modern
data analytics algorithms to nuclear non-proliferation data sets, through the
development of a framework that integrates both new and existing algorithms
and data streams.

Experience and Desired Skills
------------------------------

Candidates will be evaluated against the following criteria:

* Undergraduate experience in Nuclear Engineering, Computer Science,
  Statistics, Electrical Engineering, or relevant other field
* Interest in the application of data analytics methods for problems in nuclear non-proliferation
* Communication and collaboration skills

While not necessary, the following skills are also preferred
  
* Experience with machine learning, data fusion and data analytics
* Experience with software development

Specific Duties
---------------

* Identify and implement algorithms for use in nuclear non-proliferation
  applications, or surrogate applications as defined by consortium partners
* Develop systems for integration of various data streams and various algorithms
  to support real-world applications of algorithms     
* Collaborate with multiple research groups across consortium    
* Author publications for refereed journals and important conference proceedings
