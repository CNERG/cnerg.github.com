Research Assistant Opportunity (2020): Nuclear Facility Modeling for Nuclear Non-proliferation
==============================================================================================

*[Updated: December 1, 2019]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) is a participant
in the Signals and Source Terms research thrust area of the `Consortium for
Monitoring, Technology and Verification <http://mtv.engin.umich.edu>`_.  This
thrust area will provide insight into the set of measurable quantities at
various stages in the processing and handling of nuclear materials.

CNERG researchers develop computational models of nuclear facilities with
sufficient fidelity to simulate the time-varying nature of such measurable
quantities as those facilities engage in normal and off-normal activities.

CNERG is seeking a qualified individual to develop and validate such
computational models.  Working in collaboration with other consortium
partners, the primary measurables of interest will be identified and the
models will be improved to increase the reliability of simulating those
measurable quantities.

Experience and Desired Skills
------------------------------

Candidates will be evaluated against the following criteria:

* Undergraduate experience in Nuclear Engineering, Physics, or relevant other field
* Interest in the application of modeling and simulation for problems in nuclear non-proliferation
* Communication and collaboration skills

While not necessary, the following skills are also preferred:
  
* Experience with modeling and simulation of nuclear fuel cycle facilities
* Experience with software development

  
Specific Duties
---------------

* Identify safeguards and monitoring approaches for nuclear fuel cycle facilities
* Develop and improve nuclear fuel cycle facility models to support simulation
  of those safeguards and monitoring approaches
* Collaborate with multiple research groups across consortium    
* Author publications for refereed journals and important conference proceedings
