Post-Doctoral Associate Opportunity (2019): Nuclear Facility Modeling for Nuclear Non-proliferation
====================================================================================================

*[Updated: March 27, 2019]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) is a participant
in the Signals and Source Terms research thrust area of the `Consortium for
Monitoring, Technology and Verification <http://mtv.engin.umich.edu>`_.  This
thrust area will provide insight into the set of measurable quantities at
various stages in the processing and handling of nuclear materials.

CNERG researchers develop computational models of nuclear facilities with
sufficient fidelity to simulate the time-varying nature of such measurable
quantities as those facilities engage in normal and off-normal activities.

CNERG is seeking a qualified individual to provide leadership in the
development and validation of such computational models.  Working in
collaboration with other consortium partners, the primary measurables of
interest will be identified and the models will be improved to increase the
reliability of simulating those measurable quantities.

Degree and area of specialization
----------------------------------

* PhD in Nuclear Engineering, Physics, or related field

Required experience
---------------------

* Demonstrated experience with the development of software models for nuclear
  systems, particularly in the areas of radiation transport and nuclide
  inventory tracking

* Some experience with components of a modern team-based software development processes:

    * version control (e.g. git)
    * bug/issue tracking (e.g. github)
    * test driven development (e.g. google test and pytest)
    * automatic documentation (e.g. doxygen and sphinx)
    * build & configuration management (e.g. cmake, make)

* Strong oral and written communication skills

Desired Experience
------------------

* Familiarity with monitoring and safeguards of nuclear fuel cycle facilities
* Experience with nuclear fuel cycle simulation
* Experience with contemporary machine learning and/or data fusion algorithms
* Experience with C++ and/or python programming languages

Specific Duties
---------------

* Identify safeguards and monitoring approaches for nuclear fuel cycle facilities
* Develop and improve nuclear fuel cycle facility models to support simulation
  of those safeguards and monitoring approaches
* Mentor and advise graduate student and undergraduate researchers
* Collaborate with multiple research groups across consortium    
* Author publications for refereed journals and important conference proceedings
