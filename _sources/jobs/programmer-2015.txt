Software Quality Engineer (UW PVL# XXXXX)
==========================================

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Reasearch Group (CNERG) is actively
involved in the development of a number of software projects for the
computational modeling of complex nuclear energy systems.  All of these
projects rely on modern open source software development practices to
facilitate the implementation of new features as they transition from student
research projects to production software components. With a focus on providing
tools to analysts, CNERG strives to create robust tools that are deployable in
a variety of computing environments.

CNERG is seeking a programmer to provide leadership in software quality and
robustness as part of a team of researchers.  The primary responsibility of
this individual will be to develop and maintain aspects of each software
project that contribute to its robustness and quality, while also mentoring
students and staff in best practices for maintaing robustness and quality.
There will also be opportunities to develop and implement features 

Experience and Skills

individual will develop and
maintain aspects that 

* version control using GitHub or BitBucket
* pre-merge code review
* continuous integration & testing


alibrary to enable the direct analysis of
CAD-based geometry in Monte Carlo radiation transport: Direct Accelerated
Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC). This base library is distributed as part of an
open source development effort, while interface code for a handful of specific
Monte Carlo (MC) physics engines is distributed separately or integrated in
those codesâ€™ distributions.

CNERG is seeking an experienced programmer/software developer to:

* manage the ongoing development of DAGMC (bug fixes, feature enhancement, performance improvement),
* lead its integration into a growing set of Monte Carlo physics codes, and
* support the development of tools/workflows based on DAGMC.
