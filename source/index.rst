Welcome to CNERG
=================

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group focuses on the
nuclear design and analysis of nuclear energy systems and fuel cycle
concepts. While research activities include methods development and
methodology integration, it is generally in support of improving the
ability to perform nuclear analyses of engineering systems. As nuclear
analysts, CNERGâ€™s strengths are in modeling radiation transport and
nuclide inventory changes.

The acronym CNERG is intended to be prounced like the English word
synergy ('si-n&r-jE). According to `Merriam-Webster OnLine
<http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?synergy>`_, the noun synergy
means "a mutually advantageous conjunction or compatibility of
distinct business participants or elements". This name is suggestive
of many synergies that we take advantage of both inside the group and
with our connections to others.

Research and employment opportunities in this research group
continuously become available. If you are interested please see what
current opportunities are available.
