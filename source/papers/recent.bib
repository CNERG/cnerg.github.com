	abstract = {The use of a liquid-metal (LM) plasma-facing component (LM-PFC) in fusion reactor designs has some advantages as well as some disadvantages as compared to traditional designs that use a solid plasma-facing wall. Neutronics analysis of these potential LM-PFC concepts is important in order to ensure that radiation limits are met and that system performance meets expectations.A three-dimensional (3-D) neutronics analysis parametric study considering four LM first-wall (FW) candidates, (PbLi, Li, Sn, and SnLi) was performed with a thin (2.51-cm) LM-PFC design. The 3-D neutronics study used a fusion reactor based on the Fusion Energy Systems Study (FESS) Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) (FESS-FNSF) that served as the baseline for comparison. FESS-FNSF is a deuterium-tritium–fueled tokamak with 518 MW of fusion power. A partially homogenized 3-D computer-aided-design model of the LM-PFC FNSF design was analyzed using the DAG-MCNP5 transport code.The results show that all candidate LM designs are acceptable with 4\% to 13\% increases in the tritium breeding ratio compared to the baseline case. The peak displacements per atom at the FW decrease 2\% to 15\%. For all four LM designs examined, the magnet heating and fast neutron fluence are well below acceptable limits. Overall, the Li LM design is the best candidate from a neutronics perspective.},

However, little was known about how display characteristics interact with individuals' predispositions to affect perception of data credibility. Using an experiment with 517 participants, we tested perceptions of data credibility by manipulating data visualizations related to the issue of nuclear fuel cycle based on three characteristics: graph format, graph interactivity, and source attribution. Results showed that viewers tend to rely on preexisting levels of trust and peripheral cues, such as source attribution, to judge the credibility of shown data, whereas their comprehension level did not relate to perception of data credibility. We discussed the implications for science communicators and design professionals.},

	title = {Improved modeling of the {University} of {Wisconsin} nuclear reactor by automatic generation of computational models},
	abstract = {Computational models for the University of Wisconsin Nuclear Reactor (UWNR) exist primarily to support the design of experiments, including an impending measurement of transient reactor physics behavior. Prior modeling efforts faced inherent challenges on long term maintainability and usability. Therefore, an improved model has been built with the following features: (1) documentation with reliable source of data, (2) build consistency by virtue of automation, (3) human readability and transparency of implemented changes on the model, (4) configuration management by version control, and (5) modularity for alternate representations.
The benefits of these improvements are examined in terms of model accuracy, flexibility of modeling choices, and predictive analysis of the reactor conditions. MCNP6 demonstrated a computational bias of 604 ± 48 pcm, and Serpent showed an additional bias of 28 ± 23 pcm relative to the MCNP6 results. A study of the impact of varying modeling choices during burnup simulation found that the fuel discretization is important because of the higher fidelity representation of the temperature distribution, and therefore the variations in isotopic evolution. Estimates of the core life and power peaking factors were then generated using both MCNP6 and Serpent, using models automatically generated from the same source data.},
