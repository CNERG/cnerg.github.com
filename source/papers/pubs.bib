	abstract = {The use of a liquid-metal (LM) plasma-facing component (LM-PFC) in fusion reactor designs has some advantages as well as some disadvantages as compared to traditional designs that use a solid plasma-facing wall. Neutronics analysis of these potential LM-PFC concepts is important in order to ensure that radiation limits are met and that system performance meets expectations.A three-dimensional (3-D) neutronics analysis parametric study considering four LM first-wall (FW) candidates, (PbLi, Li, Sn, and SnLi) was performed with a thin (2.51-cm) LM-PFC design. The 3-D neutronics study used a fusion reactor based on the Fusion Energy Systems Study (FESS) Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) (FESS-FNSF) that served as the baseline for comparison. FESS-FNSF is a deuterium-tritiumâ€“fueled tokamak with 518 MW of fusion power. A partially homogenized 3-D computer-aided-design model of the LM-PFC FNSF design was analyzed using the DAG-MCNP5 transport code.The results show that all candidate LM designs are acceptable with 4\% to 13\% increases in the tritium breeding ratio compared to the baseline case. The peak displacements per atom at the FW decrease 2\% to 15\%. For all four LM designs examined, the magnet heating and fast neutron fluence are well below acceptable limits. Overall, the Li LM design is the best candidate from a neutronics perspective.},

	abstract = {As part of the expansion of the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) toolkit to support other Monte Carlo codes, FluDAG (FLUKA integrated with DAGMC) was developed. There has been increasing demand from the high energy physics community regarding Computer Aided Design (CAD) geometry support in Monte Carlo codes. In this paper, the development and validation of FluDAG is discussed and its application to a number of high energy physics experiments is demonstrated, along with its validity relative to native FLUKA calculations.},
