Research Intern Opportunity (2012): Agent-based Fuel Cycle Modeling
=====================

*[Updated: November 4, 2012]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) is
leading the development of a novel open-source agent-based platform
for the simulation of advanced nuclear fuel cycles, Cyclus
(cyclus.github.com).  The core infrastructure of this effort combines
cocnepts from operations research, computer science and nuclear
engineering to provide a flexible basis for studying the tecehnical
and socioeconomic impacts of different nuclear fuel cycle choices.

CNERG is seeking a qualified individual to assist in the development
of a robust software platform and the generation of an open source
community of user/developers.

Degree and area of specialization
----------------------------------

* Masters degress in Computer Science, Operations Research, Industrial
  Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, or related field

Required experience
---------------------

* Demonstrated experience with scientific software development
* Demonstrated knowledge of C++ & python in a linux environment
* Some experience with components of a modern team-based software development processes:

    * version control (we use git)
    * bug/issue tracking (we use github)
    * test driven development (we use google test)
    * automatic documentation (we use doxygen)
    * build & configuration management (we use cmake, make)
* Strong oral and written communication skills

Desired Experience
------------------

* Demonstrated experience with some combination of Cyclus I/O technologies including

    * XML (libxml2/libxml++)
    * SQL (sqlite)

Specific Duties
---------------

* Primary duties will include:

   * Implement new classes and methods in C++ to support user/developer requirements
   * Refactor existing code to support maintainability
   * Support documentation of source code and software usage
   * Actively support a community of user/developers with contributions to Cyclus module library

* Opportunities may also emerge for the following:
   * Investigate different schemes for combining optimization algorithms with the agent based framework
   * Author publications for refereed journals and important conference proceedings
