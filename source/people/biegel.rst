Graduate Appointment
--------------------

Graduate Researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, Nuclear Science and
Engineering Division

PhD candidate at UW-Madison

Current and Recent Projects
---------------------------
*  I'm using and developing new features for the Argonne Low-Carbon Energy Framework (A-LEAF) software tool. A-LEAF is an optimization-based tool which finds global least-cost solutions to unit commitment, economic dispatch, and capacity expansion.
*  Developing agent-based modeling capabilities for A-LEAF, in order to realistically simulate the capital investment choices of agents operating with limited local information and acting to maximize local benefits, using real-options valuation and portfolio optimization. Capabilities will help to characterize the economic and technical performance parameters required for advanced reactors to be viable commercial products.
*  Assessing economic impact of increased electric vehicle deployments and varied charging patterns on the economic viability of nuclear power
*  Modeling economic impact of minute- and hour-scale load-following capabilities for nuclear reactors in an ERCOT-like electricity market system

Education and Prior Work
------------------------

* University of Wisconsin - Madison, PhD candidate in Engineering Physics (2017-current)
* Manager, PowerAdvocate Client Services (energy consulting group) (2015-2017)
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology, BS in Nuclear Science and Engineering (2015)
