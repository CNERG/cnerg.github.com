Employment Opportunities
============================================

CNERG is frequently seeking additional group members at all levels to
assist us in our mission of delivering new computing capability for
the analysis of nuclear energy systems.

While each position will require specialized skills to fulfill that
role, staff and students at all levels will be expected to be
proficient with the basic tools of robust software development.  We
often refer to these skills collectively as `Software Carpentry`_.

Fall 2014 Graduate Student Opportunities
-----------------------------------------

CNERG is not currently planning to add any graduate students in 2014.  Those
with interest in future semesters may consider the general areas identified
below.  All of these tasks will require programming and software development
and students with demonstrated experience with `Software Carpentry`_ skills
will be preferred.  Prospective students are encouraged to `apply for graduate
study in our department <http://www.grad.wisc.edu/education/admissions/>`_ and
draw specific attention to these topics, indiciating what unique knowledge or
experiences they will bring to these tasks.

PhD Topics
~~~~~~~~~~

* **Robust workflows for CAD-based Monte Carlo radiation transport**
  This will require understanding of computational geometry, mesh
  generation, and manipulation of mesh to improve the robustness of
  analysis workflows to imperfections in the geometry or the geometry
  processing steps.

* **Adaptivity for Advanced Monte Carlo Mesh Tallies** This will
  investigate the trade-off between mesh resolution, solution fidelity
  and statistical error, relying on a combination of nuclear
  engineering and applied math.

* **Scalable mixed mesh data transfer** This will extend the existing
  capability of the DataTransferKit to support surface-surface
  transfer, using a combination of applied math and computational
  geometry knowledge.

* **Socioeconomic Metrics for Advanced Nuclear Fuel Cycles** This will
  develop software algorithms to convert fundamental fuel cycle
  simulation results into quantities that are relevant for
  socioeconomic assessment of those fuel cycles.

Master's Topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Generalized High Throughput Support for Monte Carlo Radiation
  Transport** This project will develop scripts and tools to
  distribute Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations across a
  large set of loosely coupled computing resources, including:
  multi-job setup, multi-job control and monitoring, and multi-job
  aggregation.  Target platforms will include UW-based HTCondor
  resources, Open Science Grid, and Amazon EC2.  The tools will be
  implemented in PyNE for robustness and longevity.

* **Systematic Study of Material Homogenization in Radiation
  Shielding** This project will include a number of numerical
  experiments to determine the impacts of homogenization on the
  results of Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations.  These will
  include the impact of homogenization on high-fidelity results in two
  primary configurations: homogenized shield between the source and
  region of interest, and homogenization of a region that neighbors
  the region of interest.  The impacts of homogenization on R2S
  activation workflows is a natural extension of this work.

* **Variance Reduction in Complex 3-D Geometries** This will extend
  our collaboration with ORNL on their CADIS/FW-CADIS methods, but
  applying them to CAD-based geometries and consideration of complex
  source distributions, using knowledge of nuclear engineering with
  some applied math.
