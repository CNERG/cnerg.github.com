Paul Wilson is the Grainger Professor of Nuclear Engineering in the University
of Wisconsin-Madison‘s Department of Engineering Physics. His research interests
focus on developing improved tools for computational modeling of complex nuclear
energy systems, with applications in radiation shielding, nuclear waste
management, nuclear non-proliferation and energy policy. Paul joined the
University of Wisconsin-Madison as an assistant professor in August 2001 as part
of the Energy Systems and Policy Hiring Initiative. Paul currently serves as
Chair of the Energy Analysis and Policy Graduate Certificate and on the
Governance Committee of the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies.

In addition to the research pursued by his Computational Nuclear Engineering
Research Group (CNERG), Paul has served in a number of advisory and consultant
roles. From 2001-2003, he was a member of the U.S. Department of Energy’s
Generation IV Technology Roadmap Committee. In 2010, he was engaged as a
consultant to the CEA Saclay, ERC Petten, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,
and the Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Energy Future.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada,
Paul specialized in the Nuclear Power option of the Engineering Science program
at the University of Toronto. After receiving his Bachelor of Applied Science in
Engineering Science, he began his graduate schooling in nuclear engineering at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After three years, he moved to Karlsruhe,
Germany, where he studied in the Institute for Neutron Physics and Reactor
Engineering (of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), earning his Dr.-Ing.
degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1998. Returning to Madison, Paul completed
his Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering in 1999.

Paul was the founding President of the North American Young Generation in
Nuclear [NA-YGN], an organization created to provide unique opportunities to
young professionals in all fields of nuclear science & technology. Paul has been
active in the American Nuclear Society for over 20 years, and currently serves
on its Board of Directors. Paul also represented the ANS and NA-YGN at the
international climate change negotiations in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1998), and
Bonn, Germany (1999). He is a member of the American and Canadian Nuclear
Societies, the American Society for Engineering Education and the NA-YGN.

Paul is married and has two daughters. They enjoy biking around Madison’s paths
and spending time outside.
