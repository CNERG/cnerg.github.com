## Research Interests


* Monte Carlo methods
* Radiation transport
* Hybrid activation methods
* High performance computing
* Scientific software development

## Projects

* Investigated and implemented new techniques to improve the efficiency of the Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS) method, a variance reduction technique designed chiefly to speed up shutdown dose rate analysis
  * work done with the Radiation Transport group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
* Implemented a parallel version of the activation analysis code [ALARA](https://github.com/svalinn/ALARA) using OpenMP
* Investigated the viability of using the CAD-based Monte Carlo radiation transport toolkit [DAGMC](https://github.com/svalinn/DAGMC) to model spacer grids in light water reactors to gain insight
* Devised a validation and verification and regression testing framework for DAGMC
* Conducted a parametric timing study to compare the computational efficiency of DAG-MCNP5 with that of native MCNP5
