## Graduate Appointment

I am currently developing tools to generate weight window isosurface
geometries that can be used for novel variance reduction methods in
Monte Carlo radiation transport. I am also involved in software
development on various projects and enjoy mentoring new students in research.

When not focusing on my graduate research, I am busy being a mother to my
toddler daughter and working on various crafting or other creative projects.
