There are many individual skills and tools that are used to be a successful and
efficient computational scientist.  In most cases, the time investment to learn
a new skill is quickly rewarded by an improvement in the quality or efficiency
of your research.  You are encouraged to use your research time to pursue new
skills, computational or otherwise, that will support your overall research
progress.

In particular, you should place a priority on the particular skills than enable
you to be independent in pursuing your own research.  For example, understanding
the details of compiling and installing software packages in the various
computing environments where you need them, whether developed within our group
or elsewhere, is an important skill.
