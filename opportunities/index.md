title: Current opportunities in CNERG
---

CNERG is frequently seeking additional group members at all levels to assist us
in our mission of delivering new computing capability for the analysis of
nuclear energy systems.

While each position will require specialized skills to fulfill that role, staff
and students at all levels will be expected to become proficient with the basic
tools of robust software development. We often refer to these skills
collectively as [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org).  Students
who join the CNERG community will be given opportunities to develop those
skills.  Professionals will be expected to bring some of these skills to 
the community when they arrive.

## Graduate Student Assistantships

The availability of funded assistantships varies from year to year.  Specific
graduate student opportunities may be listed below.  When recruiting graduate
students, the following characteristics are valued:

* **Curiosity**: a genuine curiosity about how our world works that fuels an independent motivation to learn new things & acquire new skills; can be demonstrated by description of past examples of pursuing something independently driven by curiosity, or by posing interesting questions about future interests
* **Speculative Reasoning**: ability to reach beyond oneâ€™s knowledge by reasoning an outcome scaffolded upon that knowledge (often best demonstrated in interview setting)  
* **Clear Communication**: ability to discuss complex topics with clarity (often best demonstrated in interview setting)
