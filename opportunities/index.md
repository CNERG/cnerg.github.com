title: Current opportunities in CNERG
---

CNERG is frequently seeking additional group members at all levels to assist us
in our mission of delivering new computing capability for the analysis of
nuclear energy systems.

While each position will require specialized skills to fulfill that role, staff
and students at all levels will be expected to become proficient with the basic
tools of robust software development. We often refer to these skills
collectively as [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org).

## Graduate Student Assistantships

The availability of funded assistantships varies from year to year.
